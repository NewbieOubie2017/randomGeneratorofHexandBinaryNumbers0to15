# randomGeneratorofHexandBinaryNumbers0to15
An educational tool to help people learn 4 bit binary and hexidecimal numbers as in bingo game

The '*Done' PDF file is a blank bingo card (not perfect but useable).

The other PDF files are example cards. I made the first by hand; for the second (16-31) card, I used the program to generate choices.  I also intentionally did not use a 'free square'.








*note I am learning GIMP and INKSCAPE as I find the energy and time. If you make a better bingo card template please share.  Thank you so very much.
